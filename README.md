🪔SIJELANTAH🪔<br>
SIJELANTAH or Used Cooking Oil Information System is a website that provides used cooking oil waste collection services which makes it easier for people who have used cooking oil waste but are confused about where to dispose of it.

By raising the issue of SDGS 12, namely Responsible Consumption and Production, this website is one of the solutions that can be provided.
